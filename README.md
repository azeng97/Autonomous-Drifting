# Autonomous-Drifting
Autonomous Drifting using Reinforcement Learning 

## Installation 
1. sudo ./setup_env.sh
2. cd fyp_ws
3. catkin_make
3. . devel/setup.bash (add ``` source [full path to setup.bash] ``` in your .bashrc)
4. roscd drift_car_env/scripts/
5. sudo pip install -e .
6. roscd drift_car/scripts/rl
7. sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

The first time you open Gazebo, it will download all models from the Gazebo servers, which may take some time. Run ``` rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo ``` to run Gazebo and install models.

## Commands
To run | Command
--- | --- 
ROS Core | ``` roscore ```
Gazebo Simulator | ``` roslaunch drift_car_gazebo drift_car.launch ```
Controller | ``` roslaunch drift_car_gazebo_control drift_car_control.launch ```
Keyboard Teleop | ``` rosrun drift_car_gazebo_control teleop_gazebo.py ```
Joystick Gazebo Controller | ``` rosrun drift_car_gazebo_control joystick_gazebo.py ```
Joystick Car Controller | ``` rosrun drift_car_gazebo_control joystick_car.py ```
Double Dueling Deep Q-Network | ```rosrun drift_car main.py```

## PILCO
1. Install MATLAB, enabled with Robotics System Toolbox. 
2. Add src/drift_car/scripts/rl/modules and src/drift_car/scripts/rl/pilco to MATLAB path.
3. Start the bridge library with ```rosrun drift_car_env matlab_bridge.py```.
4. To train - ```drift_car_learn```. 
5. To apply learned controller - ```applyController```.

## DDPG

## DQN

## PE-TS

## Car Model
To run using the Monster Truck, ```rosed drift_car_gazebo drift_car.launch``` and toggle the comments to load ```truck.xacro.urdf```.
